<p>Bartholomew JoJo "Bart" Simpson (born April 1[7] or February 23[8]) is the Deuteragonist of The Simpsons. Bart is the
    mischievous, rebellious, misunderstood, disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child. He is the only son of
    Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He also has been nicknamed "Cosmo", after
    discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous comics, such as "Critical Hit",
    "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a 100-issue comic series entitled the Simpson
    Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is loosely based on Matt Groening and his older brother, Mark Groening.</p>
<ul>
    <li>“Ay Caramba!” ―Bart's catchphrase and first words</li>
    <li>“Eat my shorts!” ―Bart's second catchphrase</li>

<h2><a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Lisa_Simpson"> Lisa Simpson</a></h2>
<img src="image/img_2.png" alt="Lisa">
<p>Lisa Marie Simpson (born May 9)[9] is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family and one of the two
    tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series.
    In "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" she is also known as Lisa Bouvier. She was named after a train called Lil'
    Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary. She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who exceeds the standard achievement of
    the intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's surprise, she is also the moral center of her family.
    In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to hobbies such as playing
    saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest in advanced studies. </p>
<ul>
    <li>“If anyone wants me, I'll be in my room.” ―Lisa's "catchphrase"</li>
    <li>“Quit it, Bart!” ―Lisa's catchphrase</li>
    <li>“BAAAAART!!” ―Lisa’s catchphrase</li>
